# Onboarding Buddy Guidelines

## Purpose
The buddy program pairs each new hire with an experienced team member to help them integrate quickly into the company’s culture, workflows, and team.

## Your Role as a Buddy
- **Welcome & Orientation:** Meet your new hire on Day 1. Help them feel comfortable and show them around (or virtually introduce them to colleagues).
- **Introduce Key People:** Facilitate introductions with teammates and cross-functional contacts.
- **Share Insights:** Explain how things *really* work here – from communication norms to tool shortcuts.
- **Check In Regularly:** At least once a week during the first month.  
- **Be Available:** Respond to questions promptly or guide them to the right resource/person.

## Best Practices
- Use plain language and avoid overwhelming with too much detail at once.
- Encourage questions, even if they seem basic.
- Proactively ask, “How’s it going?” – don’t wait for them to reach out.
- Share personal experiences to make learning relatable.

## Duration
Buddies are most active in the first 90 days, but you’re welcome to remain a point of contact beyond that.
